# text =  """David, today, included with your hygiene visit, with your cleaning, doctors asked me to go ahead and do a head and neck exam for you. Okay. I'm going to give you this graph. This actually will show you all of the lymph nodes that I'm going to be checking, and in addition, I'm going to be checking your jaw joint, the joint that allows your jaw to open and close. Now, this is a complementary service for you today. There's no charge for this, and the reason we're doing it is because the morbidity rate, that is the incidence of head and neck cancers, as well as the mortality rate, the number of deaths that occur from head and neck cancers, has been going up every year. So we're doing this as a service to our patients. Wow, that sounds serious. Well, it's not serious, but it's a really good screening tool. It would be serious if you had a problem. Okay. So we're going to screen to make sure you don't have one. Now, I've just washed my hands, so if you don't mind, I'll do your exam without gloves on. Sure. It'll be more comfortable for you, and I'll be able to actually feel better. I am going to ask you, however, to remove your headset and your glasses. Okay. And I can just put those on the counter for you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, go ahead and rest your head back against the chair, and I'm going to start right here at your jaw joint. I'm going to ask you to go ahead and open and close. Open nice and wide, big as you can. There you go, and close. And I felt a little clunking when you opened that time. Okay. Where do you feel that? Right side. Right side. Do you feel any pain or discomfort? A little bit on the left. A little bit on the left. Do you know if you clench or grind your teeth at night? I might clench a little. Do you wake up with a tired jaw in the morning? Sometimes. Sometimes you do. Okay, let me check the muscles here. Squeeze your teeth together and release. This is your masseter muscle. Any pain here? No. Okay, let's try this one. Squeeze. This is your anterior temporalis. Just release. Any pain here? On the left side. On the left side, a bit of pain. Okay, and your posterior temporalis muscle. Squeeze, release. How about here? Any pain? Okay, so the right anterior temporalis and the masseter and the jaw joint. We'll have doctor check that when he comes in. Now I'm going to start on the lymph nodes and I'm going to start here around your ears. As you can see on that graph you're holding, there's lymph nodes in front of and behind your ears. I'm going to check the lymph nodes that come out underneath your cheekbones. Most people don't even know you have lymph nodes here. And I'm going to feel underneath the jaw for these lymph nodes as well. I'm going to come right down the front of your neck. Feel your Adam's apple and the thyroid. Do you have any family history of thyroid issues that you're aware of? Not that I know of. Swallow for me. Swallow on command is kind of hard to do, isn't it? And I'm going to feel the lymph nodes that go all the way around your collarbone. So I'm going to be just right inside your collarbone, between your neck and collarbone, and I'm going to press pretty firmly. Again, for any abnormalities again from side to side. Anything that's hard, lumpy, bumpy that doesn't belong there. Turn your head to the right and just let me support it here. I'm going to feel down the back of your neck. And lift your head up. This is your sternocleidomastoid muscle and I'm going to feel right down this muscle also. Now while I have your head turned to the side, I'm going to do a skin cancer check. I'm going to look behind the ear and along the hairline for any suspicious-looking lesions that don't belong there. Do you wear sunscreen? Yes. A good idea. You're very fair-complected, what with your reddish hair and your blue eyes. So it's a good idea to keep sunscreen on. Lift your head up again real quick. There you go. Rest back. Identify that sternocleidomastoid muscle. All right, and now just looking straight ahead and rest your head back into my hands. I'm going to feel the lymph nodes here at the base of the skull. These are the occipital lymph nodes. Okay, good news. I didn't feel anything that was asymmetrical from side to side. No lumps or bumps that you need to be worried about. We'll be doing this exam for you once a year during your hygiene visits. Okay. All right, so you can look forward to that. Thanks. All right, you're welcome."""
